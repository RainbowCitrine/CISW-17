        In the beginning, Tim created HyperText Markup Language.
        The Internet was without form and void, and text was upon the
        face and keyboard. And Tim said, Let there be links; and there was
        links. And Tim saw the links Anchors, and the text He called Other Stuff.
        And the whole thing together was the first web page.
